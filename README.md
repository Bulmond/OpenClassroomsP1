This is website is a landing page for a travel agency created solely with HTML and CSS.
I will be including responsive design for mobiles and tablets. It will prioritize support on Desktop.

Currently the desktop version is complete for the most part, I need to add some finishing touches such as getting all the dimensions correctly, (Housing in Marseille Section).

overall in the OpenClassrooms Steps i am at the 10th, which is integrate responsive designs for the aforementioned mobile/tablet versions.
Once that is done all that's left is verify the code with W3C tools provided by OpenClassrooms for both HTML and CSS. And then I will be able to deliver the project and wait for it's evaluation.
